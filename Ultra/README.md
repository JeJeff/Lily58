# Lily58 Ultra
Lily58 is 6*4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This fork adds the Lily58 Ultra.  This has through-hole diodes only, and adds MX hotswap sockets, per-key and backlight LEDs, and rotary encoder support (replacing one of the thumb keys).  The LED support means it no longer supports choc switches.
